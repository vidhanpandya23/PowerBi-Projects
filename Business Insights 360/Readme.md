## Companyâ€™s background
AltiQ Hardware, a company that has experienced significant growth in recent years, has expanded its operations globally. The company specializes in selling computers and computer accessories through three different channels or mediums.

- Retailers
- Direct
- Distributors

Recently, AltiQ Hardware suffered an unexpected loss after opening a store in America. This decision was based on surveys, intuition, and some Excel analysis. Additionally, the company's competitors have well-equipped analytics teams to analyze data and make informed decisions. Therefore, AltiQ Hardware has no choice but to establish its own analytics team to gather insights from data and make better decisions for survival and success in the industry.
