# Data Analytics Portfolio Project - Power BI

## Overview

Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio Project on Power BI! This project focuses on the hospitality industry, leveraging Power BI to analyze and visualize key performance metrics for informed decision-making. I have incorporated data from multiple CSV files, including dim_date, dim_hotels, dim_rooms, fact_aggregated_bookings, and fact_bookings.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Modeling:** Designed a robust data model with efficient relationships to integrate and analyze data from various sources.
  
- **DAX Formulas:** Implemented advanced Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create calculated columns and measures, providing insights into critical metrics such as Revenue, Occupancy %, ADR, RevPAR, and more.

- **Time Series Analysis:** Developed week-over-week (WoW) change percentage calculations for key metrics, allowing trend analysis and identification of fluctuations.

- **User-Friendly Dashboard:** Created an intuitive Power BI dashboard that empowers stakeholders with real-time insights, facilitating data-driven decision-making in the hospitality sector.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **User Engagement:** Enhanced stakeholder engagement with a user-friendly Power BI dashboard, promoting efficient decision-making.

2. **Weekly Trends:** Analyzed week-over-week change percentages for Revenue, Occupancy %, ADR, RevPAR, Realisation %, and DSRN, providing valuable insights into trends and performance fluctuations.

3. **Metric Precision:** Implemented key metrics including Average Rating, Cancellation %, No Show rate %, Booking % by Platform, and Booking % by Room Class, showcasing precise data analysis capabilities.

## Project Structure

- **Data Source:** CSV files (dim_date, dim_hotels, dim_rooms, fact_aggregated_bookings, fact_bookings)
